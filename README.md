# Image-Classification
**MNIST Image Classification Project**

**Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a widely used dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), along with their corresponding labels.

**Features**
1)Data Exploration: Analysis of the MNIST dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

2)Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques such as normalization and resizing to prepare the images for training.

3)Model Building: Implementation of  machine learning algorithms including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

4)Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.

5)Deployment: Deployment of the trained model for inference on new handwritten digit images.
